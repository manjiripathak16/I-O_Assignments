Implementing queue using stacks:
1. Use two stacks
2. First move all elements from first stack to the second stack. (push into the second stack)
3. Then after entering new elements in 1st stack, pop elements from stack 2 to stack 1.
4. This causes stack one to act as a queue. (First in first out).

Applications of stacks:
Evaluating prefix, postfix, infix expressions.

Applications of Queues:
Handling interrupts.
CPU scheduling.
